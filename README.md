# Trial Division
Code for naive trial division in Python and Rust.
This was written to get particular numbers for [this stack exchange question](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/113521/45690), where someone asked how to factor $N = 237540380304900134239$ without external tools.
As $\log_2 (N) \approx 68 \leq 70$, trial division should be able to do this in $\approx \sqrt{2^{70}} = 2^{35}$ arithmetic operations.
If each arithmetic operation costs a clock cycle, one expects this to take $2^{35} / (3.7 \times 10^9)\approx 9$ seconds on a 3.7GHz machine, and $\approx 12.2$ seconds on a 2.8GHz machine.
While these estimates ignore *many* important parts of modern computing, I was curious how close they would be to the truth, hence this repository.

As the (naive) implementation in Python is very slow, I decided to speed it up, by

1. Rewriting it in Rustâ„¢, and then
2. parallelizing this Rust implementation with `rayon`.

## Timings

As the entire point of this was to obtain timing estimates for various ways of implementing trial division, I've included those estimates below (for the above $N$) on several of my machines.
These machines are

* "Laptop": Intel i7 1165G7 (4  cores, 2.8GHz) and 16GB of RAM, and
* "Desktop": Ryzen 9 5900X  (12 cores, 3.70 GHz) with 32GB of RAM.

| Implementation | Laptop Time (s) | Desktop Time (s)|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Serial Python | 908 | 689|
| Serial Rust | 20.86 | 16.78 |
| Parallel Rust | 10.81 | 2.53|

## Usage

I've wrapped both Rust implementations with a small CLI. The syntax is

    cargo run --release [NUMBER]

to factor NUMBER in parallel, and

    cargo run --release [NUMBER] --serial

to factor NUMBER in serial.

I've also included the naive `python3` implementation, but it is exceedingly boring, slow, and not even portable (it requires `tqdm` to be installed, though one could easily remove this dependency).
There is no reason I can think that anyone should want to use it ever --- I mainly include it as a reference for the above measurements.
